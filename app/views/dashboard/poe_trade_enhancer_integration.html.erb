  <h1>How to use Cadiro</h1>
  <p>
    This applications needs to be fed your live search data from the pathofexile.com/trade website. There are many ways of doing that, but the one that made more sense to us was to use <strong>PoE Trade Enhancer</strong>, a tampermonkey / greasemonkey script that will run in your browser and add functionnalities to the <a href="https://pathofexile.com/trade">pathofexile.com/trade</a> website.<br />
    When you'll do a new search and save it using <strong>PoE Trade Enhancer</strong>, your search data will be sent to your <strong>Cadiro</strong> account.
  </p>
  <p>For this to work, we have to plug ourselves into this script and add our own functionnalities, namely sending the data of your livesearches to <strong>Cadiro</strong>.</p>
  <p>This means you'll have to install an altered version of <strong>PoE Trade Enhancer</strong> which you can generate here.</p>
  <p>
    All credit goes to <strong>PoE Trade Enhancer</strong> creator <em>ghostscript3r</em>, you can find his amazing project here: <a href="https://github.com/ghostscript3r/poe-trade-official-site-enhancer">https://github.com/ghostscript3r/poe-trade-official-site-enhancer</a>.

  <p>
    If you don't have Tampermonkey or Greasemonkey installed, you can look it up <a href="https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/387586-poe-trade-enhancer">here</a>. But <em>only do the first step</em> as want to install the script from here.
